      It was probably to print a recipe or set of instructions. Maybe it was a google doc, complete with <span class="smallCaps">url</span> detritus along the footer. Even people who have been using the internet since the era of tables and inline styles can probably count the number of times they’ve found it useful on one hand. Web layouts simply aren’t meant to be navigated in a fixed, sequential space and trying to print one results in a garbled, embarrassed version of its former self.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="smallCaps">html</span> & <span class="smallCaps">css</span> are the primary tools for building a website; one is content, the other is styling. In desktop publishing terms, <span class="smallCaps">html</span> is hammering keys to write an article and <span class="smallCaps">css</span> is applying paragraph styles and kerning headlines. These languages can be pointed at a print layout just as easily as the screen by nesting <span class="smallCaps">css</span> styles inside the selector <span class="inlineCode">@media print</span>, a tool so often overlooked. If this seems like meaningless jargon but you’re interested in the relationship between web and print, hold tight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="inlineCode">@media</span> selector is normally used for detecting mobile devices and delivering a suitable layout for the viewer, but specifying that the media is print (rather than screen) can create a website that is as agreeable live-coded as hard-copied. This book aims to demonstrate a simple print stylesheet anyone can use to create texts, manuals, articles, comics, art books—anything the user might like to distribute.
    </p>
    <p>
      When searching for new information, the general reflex is to find it on the internet. It’s available anywhere and has a massive, instant return compared to libraries or asking other people. While the internet is not always the best resource, it’s undeniably the <i>first</i> for most cases. A printable website means that a reader can find it through google, be linked to it by a friend, or stumble upon it in its original form, and still walk away with a hard copy that has all the material benefits of print. It’s available offline, it can be passed to someone over coffee, it’s easily referenced and flipped-through. A print-out would always has its online companion should a web format suddenly become better suited.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the very start of developing a print framework, binding was an important aspect. In an age of infinite information, printed matter we bring into our homes is reserved for special objects. Why buy a paperback you’ll struggle to find shelf-space for when you can download it onto an e-reader for a fourth of the price? (Actually, there are a lot of answers to that question, but you’ll be spared a software monopoly tirade for the moment.) Throwaway content like news and opinion pieces, disposable in its relevance more than its quality, simply does not need to take up paper and ink anymore. When is print no longer the cheapest way to deliver textual content, it is freed of the obligation to do so—and so we have enjoyed magazines with experimental layouts, rich paper stocks, and niche interests. Sure, you could print a website with optimized or even beautiful styling, but why keep around a stack of pages stapled at the corner like a syllabus? The idea of a website manifesting as a bound book with cover & spine is ineluctable. I imagine the thrill of an industrial designer with access to a 3D printer for the first time is similar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The final (or at least <i>full</i>) version of this print framework will include binding instructions that can be hooked into the content as a chapter or section, should the author choose. There are a huge number of binding methods that can be done without any special materials, all with different aesthetic and practical qualities. A book of intaglio star chart reproductions may recommend the heaviest stock your printer can manage with a paper-lock case, whereas a textbook of Java programs that draw different cats may shrug and recommend printing in greyscale to save ink, staple if you please. Everything from saddle-stitch to a hardback Smythe-sewn is possible if a reader is determined to make a book appear where none existed previously, except in data.

      <h3 class="chapterNumber printOnly">02. Web vs. Print</h3>
      <h2 class="chapterTitle printOnly">Screens and Paper Have Different Protocols.</h2>
      <h2 class="chapterTitle noPrint">web vs. print</h2>

      <div class="pageBreak"></div>

      <h3>Barrier for Entry</h3>

      <p>Publishing on the web is different from print in almost every way except for the presence of a human creator and the written word. Even that isn’t guaranteed with the advent of embedded media and generative programming. Internet publishing has no printing costs, no chain of suppliers or distributors, and everything can be served from a remote web host with your domain slapped on the front. That’s not to say publishing online isn’t serious business, but the barrier for entry starts at about $9 a month these days (or free if you use a platform like Tumblr or Wordpress). Anyone can try their hand at being an independent publisher, and reach an incredibly wide audience without wrestling with international shipping.</p>

      <p>This has created an interesting rift where older players have a print background they must translate to web, whereas their newer colleagues know web as the default and may be lost if they’re composing spreads in a magazine. Print and screen have similarities but their visual language and protocols are necessarily different. Most of us take these nuances for granted—hypothetically you will only notice <i>poor</i> publication design in either medium, whereas great design is glossed over comfortably. Have you ever had to zoom in on a mobile device because the text was so small and hard to read? Or been annoyed by a huge sans-serif font in a magazine? The designer was probably trying to tackle both mediums at once (a request that seems trivial until attempted), or struggled in the translation between standards.</p>

      <h3>Typography</h3>

      <p>It’s old wisdom that the most important aspect of typography to get right is your body text (<i>text type</i>) because it makes up 90% of the text on the page, even online. Elements like headlines, subtitles, and pull-quotes usually get to be treated with fancier or more interesting fonts (<i>display type</i>) but they’re rarely longer than a line or two, and readability is less stringent.</p>

      <p>Serif typefaces were the first ever created, and there is a rich library to choose from for printed text type. Letters with serifs are easier to read because their letter-shapes are very distinct from each other: we can recognize the shape of an entire word quickly without confusion between <i>I</i> and <i>l</i> or <i>p</i> and <i>q</i>. Reading long blocks of text is very comfortable with a good serif face, and it’s hard to go wrong when choosing between classics like Caslon and Garamond which have been iterated upon for centuries.</p>

      <p>
        <img class="floatImg" src="images/sans_serif.png">
        Sans-serif typefaces are the staple for text type on screens. Most screens have a resolution of 72 <span class="smallCaps">dpi</span> (dots per inch) and the fine details of serif typefaces become fuzzy, as pictured left in an exaggerated example. Hairlines and ball terminals look spotty and jagged, which is not only a disservice to the typeface but irritating to read. Sans-serifs, on the other hand, are usually fairly mono-weight and render much more faithfully on screens. There’s a reason the system font on your computer is Tahoma or San Francisco (maybe even Ubuntu); all sans-serifs designed for screens specifically.
      </p>

      <p>A common design choice is for display type to be the opposite of text type in terms of serifs, and so you’ll often see a flip-flop between print and screen: screen text is sans-serif and print text is serif, and both will have the opposite for their display type. However, using serif typefaces has become more and more acceptable as screen resolutions improve, and web publishers are able to choose their font pairings with more options. The luxe, textural appearance of serif text type is finally an option for web publishing, and so the print-classic pairing of a display sans and text serif has made its way onto our screens. High resolution displays and ever-improving web fonts are allowing web publishers to experiment with print design vocabulary and blur the lines between what you might see scrolling online and what you might see turning the page in a magazine.</p>

      <p>To make an example, this book is using Freight Text for text type and Apercu Pro for display. Freight Text was designed primarily for screen use, and comes packaged with the still-rare ability to render intermediate typography like small caps, swashes, and contextual alternates through <span class="smallCaps">css</span>. Apercu Pro, on the other hand, is a beautiful display typeface and a horrible choice for body text. Its design would not be nearly as popular if we were still stuck using only sans-serifs just like it online. Being able to choose a serif text type like Freight Text also means accessing more expressive italics, as most sans-serifs have a bland italic font that is simply skewed to the right. It may even be called "oblique" instead of italic in the font files. There are exceptions, but the fact that italics are meant to be a different (albeit related) font entirely from their regular/Roman version is most apparent in serif typefaces.</p>

      <h3>Technical Differences</h3>

      <p>So, the world of typography has opened up for web publishers. Great! There are still limitations (web fonts can slow down loading times and don’t have as many bells & whistles as their desktop-to-print counterparts) but a huge gap has been bridged between web and print. However, it’s worth examining fundamental differences between the mediums so we can understand how they can be translated. This book has attempted to convert formal elements where an equilibrium (such as using serif text type) isn’t possible. While print has changed over time with innovations like desktop publishing and offset printing, web publishing is improving exponentially faster, as computer-based technology tends to do. Speed of innovation isn’t necessarily better; web development is constantly suffering growing pains as new standards and software are adopted slower than they are created. However, if something you want to create online isn’t possible, it’s never a long wait.</p>

      <h3>Links</h3>
      <p>Hyperlinks mean external sources can have their location embedded in the text, and being able to click on one and arrive somewhere new is a hallmark of web publication (and the internet in general). Print has several ways of referencing external sources so the purpose of the link has to be considered. An easy option is adding the actual <span class="smallCaps">url</span> inline with a <span class="smallCaps">css</span> pseudo class. If the <span class="smallCaps">html</span> for a clickable link online looks like this:
      <span class="code"><&zwj;a href=“http://google.com”>google<&zwj;/a></span>
      adding a pseudo class in the @media print stylesheet which expands the print would look like this:
      <span class="code">a::after {<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;content: " (" attr(href) ")";<br>
      }</span>
      The <span class="inlineCode">content</span> is whatever is inside of the <span class="inlineCode">href</span> attribute in the last example. And now a printed link to google (http://google.com) expands itself.</p>

      <p>The problem with this method is the assumption that your reader will put down the book, open a browser on a  nearby device, and type the link in. It’s better than no link at all if there’s any ambiguity about what you’re referencing or how to find it, but it’s kind of like saying “here’s the source, I’ve done my journalistic duty, you can go find it if you really want”. It acts more like a <i>Further Reading</i> suggestion than a connected piece of information. Chicago-style footnotes and annotated citations, more commonly found in scholarly journals than magazines, do a much better job of providing context <i>in the moment</i>. In the print stylesheet, you can add a similar pseudo class that appends a footnote indicator instead of an entire link:
      <span class="code">a::after {<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;content: “1”;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;font-size: 6pt;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;vertical-align: super;<br>
      }</span>
      which adds a small numeral (in this case, 1) as superscript after your link. The footer of your page can now host not just the location of that source but a brief summaryor annotation. Attaching a custom class like “printOnly” and hiding it in the screen stylesheet means it will only reveal itself when the reader accesses the <i>print</i> stylesheet. An <i>unordered list</i> with two <i>list items</i> in the footer serves quite well:
      <span class="code"><&zwj;footer><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<&zwj;ul><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<&zwj;li>1. Dr. Suess’s study concluded that the green-ness of breakfast food had no effect on its taste compared to un-dyed foods when subjects were blindfolded.<&zwj;/li><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<&zwj;li>2. While it makes some ground-breaking discoveries regarding the social structures of Whos, the reader should be cautioned that <i>Horton Hears a Who</i> does use some racist and out-dated language.<&zwj;/li><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<&zwj;/ul><br>
      <&zwj;/footer></span>

      which can then by styled in the screen stylesheet as
      <span class="code">footer {<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;display: none;<br>
      }</span>

      and in the print stylesheet as per your requirements—probably fixed to the bottom of the page with a rule divider and smaller text, but the world is your oyster.</p>

      <p>The elegance of this solution is thwarted by the fact that any attempt to fix a footer to the bottom of the page does not work when printing without some front-end programming. As far as your browser is concerned, the bottom of the page is the bottom of <i>the entire web page</i>, not where paper ends or page breaks are inserted into the code. Mozilla and Chrome make use of the <span class="smallCaps">css</span> selector <span class="inlineCode">@page</span>, which allows styling page-specific values like margins and size, but its footer and layout functionality is limited.</p>

      <p>The more advanced your solution is, the more likely it is you’ll have to employ programming languages like Javascript or Ruby, which allow the use of much more complex logic and parameters to construct the page. At risk of scaring anyone away from learning these very useful languages, adding scripts to your page increases its complexity on more than one level. However, it does mean you can easily insert content into “templates” you’ve written yourself. Web programming generally lets you be more prescriptive and yet more flexible in how content is retrieved and arranged.</p>

      <h3>Book Anatomy</h3>
      <p>Traditional print media—specifically books and magazines—has an anatomy of parts that isn’t often mirrored online. Because it exists as a sequential structure without links for direct navigation, things like a table of contents and an index are necessary. This is where the creative coding of a website becomes more valuable. With some class selectors and page breaks you can turn a horizontal navigation bar into a vertical table of contents and entire sections can be swapped with more print-appropriate content. A <i>Further Reading</i> section might link to web articles online and books that can be found in a local library in print. Showing and hiding elements that only work in one medium (video, for example) can become an embedded game of hide and seek.</p>

      <p>The most disappointing pitfall of using <span class="inlineCode">@media print</span> is the lack of flexibility in styling elements as ink on a page. Regular print can take advantage of sprawling spreads and predictable text layout, but using a print stylesheet hooked up to <span class="smallcaps">html</span> means everything is rendered one page at a time, with no reference to things on pages that came before or after. Developing a print stylesheet for this book made it apparent that the existence of things like <span class="inlineCode">@page</span> and recto-verso margins are luxuries in the first place. However, this does put some creative constraints on developers and authors which may forge something more interesting than having free reign in inDesign.</p>

      <p>With more context, it can be reiterated that the goal of this publication is to serve as a first draft for a web-to-print development framework. Several online publications have created print stylesheets but they more-or-less just strip the web version of anything that won’t print well, such as links and navigation bars. <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS-Tricks</a><span class="footNumber">1</span>, a site filled with tutorials and tips for working with <span class="smallCaps">css</span>, has one that aims to strip away print-unfriendly content and make the text as readable as possible. They know their pages will be printed as offline reference material, and creating a beautiful print layout would require more wrangling than their readers really need.</p>

        <a class="noDot" href="http://supercommunity.e-flux.com/topics/supercommunity/"><img src="images/eflux_pdf.png" class="floatImg dropShadow noPrint"></a>
        <a href="#furtherReading">Many web publications</a> do put a lot of sweat and tears into providing both formats in their optimized glory, but they are developed separately—the print version is a product for purchase put together by print designers. <i>e-flux journal</i> has a (rather genius) <a href="http://supercommunity.e-flux.com/issue/"><span class="smallCaps">pdf</span> generator</a><span class="footNumber">2</span> with a variety of templates but it’s proprietary software.
      </p>

      <p>A web framework can have many forms but the simplest is a pre-made <span class="smallCaps">css</span> stylesheet. <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a><span class="footNumber">3</span> and <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a><span class="footNumber">4</span> both have dense stylesheets you can reference in your <span class="smallCaps">html</span> code, and styling a page is as simple as slotting classes into tags that match your purpose, such as “navbar” or “button”. And, of course, it’s always possible to add your own <span class="smallCaps">css</span> on top as a separate stylesheet should you want to customize it further.</p>

      <p>As it stands, this books’s stylesheets are far too customized for public use (though feel free to peak at it via <span class="inlineCode">right click > View Page Source</span>; they’re linked inside the <span class="inlineCode"><&zwj;head></span> tag). Experimenting with all the abilities and limitations of <span class="inlineCode">@page</span> and <span class="inlineCode">@media print</span> meant some jerry-rigging and the use of magic numbers. A final public version will be released by the end of 2015, available on <a href="https://github.com/laurelobrien">GitHub<span class="footNumber">5</span></a>. However, <span class="smallCaps">html</span> and <span class="smallCaps">css</span> are quick to get started with if you’re not yet familiar with them, and the ability to create and modify your own content online is incredibly liberating.</p>

        <h3>Protocol: How control exists after decentralization</h3>
        <h4>Alexander R. Galloway, 2004</h4>
        <p><i>Protocol</i> explains how strict structures and systems must exist for networks to function, and that the internet is built on <i>control</i>, not freedom. Computers are incredibly literal, which means those of us who interface with them must obey protocols if we hope to communicate effectively, such as how a browser renders code or what software is installed on a reader’s computer. This very book follows strict <span class="smallCaps">css</span> protocols so that something unusual and creative—printing it—is possible (although not without its own frustrations).</p>

        <h3>Print is Dead. Long Live Print: The world’s best independent magazines</h3>
        <h4>Ruth Jamieson, 2015</h4>
        <p>Ruth Jamieson has collected examples of independent magazines succeeding where Big Print fails in a series of case studies titled <i>Print is Dead. Long Live Print</i>. Jamieson believes that print as we knew it for hundreds of years has been slain by web publishing, but like a forest fire its death clears the way for new growth. Today’s magazines can afford to be unconcerned with immediacy, universal appeal, or competing with the internet’s torrent of information. Niche, material, and innovation are king.</p>

        <h4>Allen Hurlburt, 1971</h4>
        <p>Publication design is such a wide and varied topic that it’s hard to begin recommending books about it. However, Hurlburt’s book is classic and, being written before the advent of web publication, can provide some insight into how print worked back then when it wasn’t influenced by or competing with screens(besides some very early-stages desktop publication).</p>

    <h3 class="chapterNumber printOnly">05. glossary</h3>
    <h2 class="chapterTitle printOnly">
      web & print designers use a lot of jargon.
    </h2>
    <h2 class="chapterTitle noPrint">glossary of terms</h2>
    
    <div class="pageBreak"></div>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <p>stands for <i>Hyper Text Markup Language</i>. <span class="smallCaps">html</span> is the base language websites are written in. Content is wrapped in “tags” which indicate to the browser what sort of element it is, such as a header, footer, link, etc.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>CSS</h3> <p>stands for <i>Cascading Style Sheet</i>. <span class="smallCaps">css</span> is a coding language that selects elements in a website’s <span class="smallCaps">html</span> and dictates what that element should look like and how it affects other elements. Giving the header a white background with text inside it aligned to the right would look like:
        <span class="code">header {<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: #ffffff;<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;text-align: right;<br>
        }</span>
        <span class="smallCaps">html</span> is the content, and <span class="smallCaps">CSS</span> is how it looks.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Perfect Binding</h3> <p>method of binding a book by aligning loose sheets of paper along their intended spine and applying glue, usually with a brush or palette knife. Thick magazines and soft-cover books are usually bound this way. A cover and even a dust-jacket can be added.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Section</h3> <p>the “section” of paper you fold together like a taco to create facing pages. Usually this is for smythe-sewn binding but sometimes perfect binding too. Sections are stacked and sewn together or otherwise bound through their fold edges. Some forms of Japanese binding face the section fold towards the fore-edge of the book to keep pages double-layered, usually because of the use of extremely thin paper. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Fore-edge</h3> <p>the edge of a page that faces away from the spine. This is the edge you usually grab to turn the page.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Head</h3> <p>the top edge of a page.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Tail</h3> <p>the bottom edge of a page.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Media Query</h3> <p>a <span class="smallCaps">CSS</span> statement that asks a browser what device or media the browser is serving your content to, such as screen or print. All the styles wrapped inside the query will apply if the media matches its rules; a media query of <span class="code">@media screen and max-width < 480px</span> will have its styles applied to the page if the device is a screen and less than 480 pixels wide, such as an iPhone 5 or most Android devices.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Front-end Pro-<br>gramming</h3> <p><span class="smallCaps">html</span> & <span class="smallCaps">css</span> are <i>not</i> programming languages, but rather mark-up and styling languages. The word “programming”, like “font”, is used incorrectly a lot because of the mythos around "coding" and computer science in general. Programming languages like Javascript or Ruby can use variables, complex logic, and algorithms to serve content dynamically and contextually. Front-end programming refers to programming for web design specifically; the front-end is what the user sees and interacts with.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Internet Browser</h3>
        <p>While we use browsers all the time, from a development perspective you need to know that they don't just connect us to the internet, they render a website's code as layouts and visuals and interactive elements. Each browser is made by a different company or organization, and while they try to be consistent with each other, they all have different philosophies and standards about how things should be rendered. This is the source of Internet Explorer being a groan-worthy joke; it renders code so differently from other browsers that developers often ignore its requirements entirely or put in lower-quality alternatives for IE users to save a headache.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

      <ol>
        <li><span class="smallCaps">https://css-tricks.com/</span>.<br> CSS-Tricks is a blog dedicated to <span class="smallCaps">CSS</span> and ways it can replace programming like Javascript and PHP.</li>
        <br>
        <li><span class="smallCaps">http://supercommunity.e-flux.com/issue/</span>.<br> <i>e-flux journal</i> distributes the print version of their publication by sending <span class="smallCaps">PDF</span>s to publishers made from their PDF generator. The generator itself was written by Adam Florin in Ruby—at the time of printing this book, his blog post about its development is offline but was previously located at http://adamflorin.com/work/e-flux-journal-layout-generator.</li>
        <br>
        <li><span class="smallCaps">http://getbootstrap.com/</span>.<br> Bootstrap was developed by Twitter as a column-based web framework and is one of the most popular ever. It exists as a very long stylesheet containing hundreds of styling options as classes which can be attached to your <span class="smallCaps">html</span>. You’ve probably used hundreds of websites built with builtstrap, generally characterized by its "jumbotron" landing image with a carousel cycle of images.</li>
        <br>
        <li><span class="smallCaps">http://foundation.zurb.com/</span>.<br> Foundation is a web framework like Bootstrap, with less focus on styling typography and other aesthetic elements for you. It is also incredibly popular—the popularity of both an indicator of what poor-shape column-based layouts on the web are in. While they may seem the default they can require some taming and jerry-rigging.</li>
        <br>
        <li><span class="smallCaps">https://github.com/laurelobrien</span>.<br> That’s me! Github is a version-control and collaboration tool. With Git you can “commit” changes to a file or project you can roll back or compare changes between versions, and Github is the online tool that syncs it all for public browsing. Github is one of the cornerstones of open-source software today; everything you want to sync with Github is public, and the entire interface is based around downloading, cloning, pushing changes to other people’s projects and accepting feedback. The entire project folder for this book is viewable there, as will be the final public-use version of the print stylesheet.</li>
